# Social Notes #

## Greater understanding through crowdsourced notes. ##

Good notes are hard to come by, make note taking a snap by writing them with friends!

## Problem ##
  > For most people note taking is a solitary practice, it's dull, and it's easy to miss key-information when you are writing something down.

## Solution ##
  > By engaging peers in the process of note-taking, the notes that are generated will contain more detail, and be enriched by nuances in understanding from multiple sources, resulting in a better overall document.

## Quote from our CEO ##
  > It is my earnest desire to see the world come to a greater understanding through technology, and I hope that in some small way this can help others achieve that goal. - John Tirelli - 2020

## How to Get Started ##
  > Simply, install this package, use the command npm start and navigate to the ip of the host computer.
  > Log in from there and start chatting with your colleagues, if you find yourself chatting about some important detail mark that message to be saved in your file folder. At the end of the day, take a look at your file folder and your chat logs and pull any details that you would like to add to your entry for the day and publish it!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Before SEYS, I never kept a journal to refer back to. I was always searching my email and chat clients for things that I saw someone else say or things I myself said. It was a mess! Now if I see something that I know I may need to refer back to later, I save it for later, simple as that! I don't know how I ever got anything done before SEYS.
