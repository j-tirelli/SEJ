There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

# Social Notes #

## Greater understanding through crowdsourced notes. ##

Good notes are hard to come by, make note taking a snap by writing them with friends!

## Problem ##
  > For most people note taking is a solitary practice, it's dull, and it's easy to miss key-information when you are writing something down.

## Solution ##
  > By engaging peers in the process of note-taking, the notes that are generated will contain more detail, and be enriched by nuances in understanding from multiple sources, resulting in a better overall document.

## Quote from our CEO ##
  > It is my earnest desire to see the world come to a greater understanding through technology, and I hope that in some small way this can help others achieve that goal. - John Tirelli - 2020

## How to Get Started ##
  > Simply, install this package, use the command npm start and navigate to the ip of the host computer.
  > Log in from there and start chatting with your colleagues, if you find yourself chatting about some important detail mark that message to be saved in your file folder. At the end of the day, take a look at your file folder and your chat logs and pull any details that you would like to add to your entry for the day and publish it!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Before SEYS, I never kept a journal to refer back to. I was always searching my email and chat clients for things that I saw someone else say or things I myself said. It was a mess! Now if I see something that I know I may need to refer back to later, I save it for later, simple as that! I don't know how I ever got anything done before SEYS.
